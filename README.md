# PHP Google Chat Webhook
A simple contact form data to Google Chat via webhooks

This repository contains a simple contact form that allows users to submit their name, contact information, and a message. The form data is sent to Google Chat using a webhook.

1. Open the contact_form.html file in a web browser to view the contact form.
2. Fill in the form fields (Name, Contact Information, Message) and click the "Submit" button.
3. Check the response message displayed on the page to see if the form submission was successful.

Before using the contact form, make sure to configure the Google Chat webhook URL. Open the contact_form.php file and replace 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL' with your actual Google Chat webhook URL.
